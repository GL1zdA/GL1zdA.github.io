      "description": "I need to clear up a little bit of really flagrant misinformation here<br><br>Digital Sight and Sound, a dallas based system integrator, run a little blurb in their customer update newsletter that seriously misrepresents my experiences with intergraph and sgi hardware.<br><br>The title was \"Z-13 versus sgi maximum impact, Z-13 wins\" and it included statements like \"After two weeks of grueling tests, the z-13 finished 2.5 times faster overall than the Maximum IMPCT... and at less than 1/2 the price!!!\". This just isn't true, in saveral ways.<br><br>The last time I did side by side system testing involving SGI was pitting an SGI high impact against a intergraph GLZ1T. For heavy texture mapping applications like I was doing, the SGI high impact was three times faster than the intergraph. A realizm-13t is 2.5 times faster than the older GLZ1T, but a max impact is twice as fast as a high impact, so intergraph's best is still only half the speed of sgi's best workstation.<br><br>For the record, here is my impression of the 3D hardware I have worked with, unedited. Prices are for configurations as we would use them, not minimum.<br><br><em>Rendition Verite</em>: ($150) It won't set any speed records, but it is an excellent value, the quake port is pretty good, and the risc architecture allows a lot of room for optimization.<br><br><em>3DFX</em>: ($300) The highest textured fill rate of anything short of high end SGI hardware. 50 mpix, almost irrespective of options. You can't run a desktop or high res display on it, but at 640*480 it will stomp any other consumer level board, given equal optimization effort.<br><br><em>3dlabs permedia</em>: ($300) Right now, this is the only well supported low end open GL card. and a good all around video card. The visual quality is hurt over most other 3d boards because the internal paths apear to be 15 bits, so you don't get dithered 24 bit color out of your blending operations. The fill rate is very sensitive to what options (z buffer, blending, color depth, etc) you have turned on. It peaks at over 40 mpix, but that is with no zbuffering and 4 bit textures. Realistic cases (16 bit textures, z buffering, perspective, bilinear) bring you down to around 10 mpix. There are some performance hangups in the drivers for heavy texturing applications, but 3dlabs is working on improving them.<br><br>The remaining boards are pretty much for professional use, not gaming.<br><br><em>Dynamic Pictures Oxygen</em>: ($1500) I can't reccomend this to anyone doing texture mapping. It was slow and had rasterization errors.<br><br><em>3dlabs glint-TX</em>: ($1000 - $3000) A reletively low fill rate (15 mpix peak, often a bit lower), but fairly stable in performance. Good GL drivers. Capable of supporting very high resolutions and amounts of texture memory. Available from several vendors at various (professional) price points.<br><br><em>Intergraph intense-3d</em>: ($2000 - $5000). The fill rate still isn't very good (15 mpix), but it hardly cares when you turn on trilinear and blending. They rape you on the texture memory prices. I have gotten better performance (but not tons better) out of this than any glint card I have tested, but I have yet to use one of the dual TX boards. They are also incompatable with a lot of motherboards.<br><br><em>Intergraph realizm</em>: ($7000 - $12000) The best graphics card you can buy for NT. As far as I know, you can't even get these seperately, you have to buy them as part of an intergraph system. The systems we use list around $30k each. The fill rate is 33 mpix, and very insensitive to options. You can add an optional geometry board to get very high transform/light throughput. DEC resells these as their Powerstorm T series cards for alpha systems.<br><br><em>SGI O2</em>: ($10000, full system) The fill rate was better than intergraph's high end, but the triangle throughput was lower. I expect SGI will be able to optimize the porformance more in the coming months. It's not a knock-your-socks-off performer, but a real, fully configured system costs less than just the video option on a high end intergraph.<br><br><em>SGI IMPACT</em>: ($25000 - $50000, full system) excellent fill rate and geometry rate. A very balanced, high performace system. The texture memories are very small (one or four megs), so it would probably be possible to contruct a pathalogical case that probably puts an intergraph ahead of it, but you would have to stretch. The prices are higher than intergraph, but only by about 30%.<br><br><em>SGI Infinite reality</em>: ($100000+) Fill rate from hell. Polygons from hell. If you don't trip up on state changes, nothing will come within shouting distance of this system. You would expect that.<br><br>Our decision to go intergraph/NT over SGI/IRIX had a lot more to do with the NT vs IRIX part of it. I wish I could buy SGI hardware for NT. The last two SGI systems I did serious work on were messes of instability, but the O2 we just got last week does actually seem stable.<br><br>As far as the \"which video card should I buy?\" question from gamers, I'm afraid I can't give you a definitive answer. All of the first generation boards have some problem or another. The second generation, coming out within the next six months or so, will be more solidly positive."

      "description": "<h3>June 26, 1997 (early AM)</h3>Holee shit.<br><br>We got the PCX2 up and running, and it WORKS! Not only does it work, it's FAST! On our reference platform (P5/200 w/ MMX, 32MB RAM), we get the following performance numbers (TIMEDEMO DEMO1, no status bar, no console, best of 2 runs):<table><tr><th>CARD</th><th>512x384</th><th>640x480</th><th>800x600</th></tr><tr><td>Diamond Monster3D</td><td>36.4fps</td><td>26.2fps</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>NEC/VideoLogic PCX2</td><td>26.1fps</td><td>22.4fps</td><td>18.1fps</td></tr></table><br><br>It's no Voodoo Killer at this stage, but it's within spitting distance, and that is WAY more than any other accelerator on this planet can say.<br><br>As CPU speed gets faster, I'm pretty sure the PCX2 will scale better than the Voodoo, since the PCX2 is hurt pretty badly by triangle setup. It's entirely possible that a PCX2 would be faster than a 3Dfx in something like a Pentium2/266MHz. I plan on setting up a small lab in Sandy's former office to get a feel for how different hardware accelerators scale with CPU.<br><br>The PCX2 has several distinct advantages over its competitors. For starters, it runs at pretty high resolutions like 800x600. It also is a pretty inexpensive card (if pricing trends follow that of PCX1). It doesn't require a pass-through cable. And it will run in a window. It supports real per-pixel MIP mapping. All in all, it's a pretty amazing board for GLQuake and Quake2.<br><br>All is not perfect in PowerVR land, however. There were some minor glitches in the PCX2, and the lack of src*dst blending will hamper its ability to support colored lighting in Quake2. Also, keep in mind that while catching up to the Voodoo (almost) is an impressive feat, it's not enough to make you a world leader, especially given that 3Dfx is moving forward at least as fast as the rest of the industry. I expect 3Dfx' next generation of technology to soundly dish out some whoop-ass to the rest of the 3D accelerator manufacturers out there, but at least it's nice to know that 3Dfx finally has a reason to almost worry.<br><br>Which is good for all of us, since competition is a good thing (unless, of course, you're the one getting whooped upon).<br><br>On a related note, these performance numbers are without implementing any of the extension type mechanisms I've babbled about recently. If we do something to make particle systems and multi-pass rendering go faster, it should benefit everyone. 3Dfx and PowerVR will both benefit from these typs of extensions tremendously, especially the PowerVR.<br><br>Finally, I'd like to say that we are willing to work with hardware vendors that don't suck. NEC/VideoLogic and, specifically, their OpenGL driver engineer, have done a tremendous job with their driver, showing a lot of creativity and dedication to getting GLQuake running on their hardware. We appreciate it when an IHV takes the time to make an id product look good, and if they've done a good job (such as 3Dfx and PowerVR), we reciprocate as much as possible, which typically involves doing enhancements that improve visual quality and/or performance on their accelerator.<br><br>So in all likelihood we'll be looking at those extension issues a little closer in the upcoming weeks.<br><br>Having two consumer graphics boards that are already checked out for GLQuake and Quake2 REALLY makes me feel good. My target is at least four consumer boards for Christmas release, and I've already got two, with at least four more to evaluate (3DLabs Permedia2, Rendition V2200, ATI Rage Pro, and NVidia RIVA128).<br><br>Tomorrow I'll get a Permedia 2 and will hopefully be able to comment on its performance too, assumig 3DLabs allows me.<br><br>Oh, a quick note about test systems. Yes, a P5/200MMX isn't really \"average\" for many people, but by Christmas I'm expecting it to sort of be the average machine that someone who just bought a system will have. A more reasonable \"average\" machine is likely to a be a P5/133 or a P5/166, but I don't have one of those lying around.<br><br>Our low-end will be a P90 w/ 16MB, 32MB if you use OpenGL. Our mid-range test machine will be that P5/200MMX w/ 32MB. Our high-end test machine hasn't shown up yet, but will likely be a Pentium II 266MHz (which will be a lot cheaper by Christmas).<br><br>Some definitions:<br><br>\"Low-end\" means the minimum system we'd expect someone to use. Usually a system that was the best you could buy about two to three years ago.<br><br>\"Mid-range\" means a system likely to have been purchased within about a year of the release of our game.<br><br>\"High-end\" means a system that would have been bought within about two months of release of our game.<br><br>So don't panic if you have a P5/120, Quake2 will run alright on it. But if you have a Pentium II/300MHz, Quake2 will absolutely ROCK!<h3>June 26, 1997 (late PM)</h3><br><br>Texas Instruments came by and dropped off a stack of Permedia2 boards that we could use for testing. It's become pretty apparent that the 3DLabs drivers are significantly less stable under Win95 than under WinNT. I'm unsure if this is related to the drivers themselves or the ICD implementation from Microsoft under Win95.<br><br>So we reran some benchmarks today. Today we tested the Voodoo vs. Permedia2 vs. PowerVR PCX2. The results are as follows:<br><br>(FPS scores for TIMEDEMO DEMO1, no status bar, P5/200MMX w/ 32MB of RAM)<table><tr><th>Card</th><th>512x384</th><th>640x480</th><th>800x600</th></tr><tr><td>Voodoo (nosync)</td><td>47.6</td><td>32.7</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Voodoo (sync)</td><td>36.4</td><td>26.2</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>PowerVR PCX2</td><td>26.1</td><td>22.4</td><td>18.1</td></tr><tr><td>Permedia 2, 16bpp</td><td>23.7*</td><td>18.3</td><td>13.0</td></tr><tr><td>Permedia 2, 24bpp</td><td>21.1*</td><td>15.9</td><td>N/A</td></tr></table>* 512x384 window on a 640x480 desktop<br><br>Some observations and comments.<br><br>1. Voodoo still kicks the living shit out of everything in existence. I'm sure that this disparity between 3Dfx and the rest of the known world won't be as obvious in the future, but for the time being the Voodoo is still the pimp master chipset.<br><br>2. There is a huge performance difference between enabling sync vs. nosync with the 3Dfx, for obvious reasons (use SET FX_GLIDE_SWAPINTERVAL=0 to disable sync). Whether a game is playable sans vertical synchronization is debatable, but the tearing _is_ visible and a little disconcerting. But if frame rate is all you care about...<br><br>3. The Permedia2 has many of the same problems as the Permedia and the PowerVR boards, specifically lack of blending modes that are compatible with GLQuake and Quake2. Since this now brings us up to two boards that fall into the classification of \"boards that run Quake reasonably yet won't support colored lighting\" it's becoming more apparent that we need to really look at supporting monochrome light maps.<br><br>4. There is only a very slight performance hit for running in 24bpp vs. 16bpp with the Permedia2 - 10 to 15%. And it looks MUCH better in 24bpp - the Permedia2 has pretty startlingly grainy dither patterns when running in 16bpp.<br><br>5. Permedia2 has several distinct advantages over the other chipsets. For starters, it's a full Windows accelerator with VGA support. It also includes a _full_ OpenGL implementation (well, as full as 3DLabs good manage *ahem*). While performance for the Permedia2 dragged behind the others by a reasonable amount.<br><br>6. The Permedia2 was notably lack per-pixel MIP mapping, and this becomes _real_ obvious when you get used to playing with MIP mapping. It's also unclear whether the Permedia2 was synching to vertical retrace during swaps. If it wasn't, it's performance will likely degrade even further once syncing is enabled (if it is at all).<br><br>7. I'm still confident that if we tweak Quake2 a bit (i.e. doing something to enhance particle system performance and multitexture stuff) that the PCX2 will get pretty close to the 3Dfx in terms of real world performance (i.e. with sync enabled). If we get a 30-40% increase in performance (which isn't out of the question), that's enough for it to catch up. Similar performance gains for doing the same thing with the Voodoo likely won't give us as large a return, since the Voodoo is fill-rate limited. Maybe a 10-15% performance increase would be possible.<br><br>The Permedia2 is beginning to look like the \"No Brainer Cheap Level Editing Board\". Its performance in QuakeEd is exactly half of that of the Realizm, but a Permedia2 board w/ 8MB should cost well under $1000, while a Realizm would cost many times that. Not only that, but once we hack in the support for white light maps the Permedia2 might even make a good GLQuake/Quake2 board if you run at a lower resolution (400x300?). Lack of colored lighting is a pretty big bitch with the Permedia2, since a level editor won't be able to test lighting on a Permedia2, but other than that it looks like a fine level editing graphics adapter -- reasonable performance, features, and price.<br><br>And it runs under both Win95 and WinNT.<br><br>The Realizm still outclasses the Permedia2 in every way, but at a pretty hefty increase in price and also at the cost of losing Win95 support.<br><br>Anyway, I'm pretty damn happy. We now have three boards that will easily run Quake2 by Christmas. I'm still waiting on the Rendition V2200, ATI Rage Pro, and NVidia RIVA128. I'm also anxious to test the E&S 3DPro and Glint MX to see how well they represent the high-end of WinNT OpenGL accelerators.<br><br>Best case scenario right now gives us around 8-10 boards capable of running Quake2 out of the box by Christmas. These boards would be the Voodoo/Voodoo2, ATI Rage Pro, NVidia RIVA 128, TriTech Pyramid3D, Rendition V2200, 3DLabs Permedia2, PowerPVR PCX2, Voodoo Rush, and whatever else is available in the consumer space. Obviously some of the higher end CAD boards would hopefully run it, including the Intergraph Realizm and Intense 3D 1000, Dynamic Pictures Oxygen (although they have LONG way to go...), Real3D R3D 100, E&S 3DPro, and 3DLabs Glint MX.<br><br>If I have 4 consumer accelerators and 2 high-end accelerators \"Quake2 Ready\" I will be very happy. If I have significantly more than that I will be abso-fucking-lutely ECSTATIC, and I think 6 consumer accelerators and 4 high-end accelerators isn't out of the question.<br><br>Things are looking up in the hardware world and for OpenGL in general.<br><br><br><br>[HOOK] ignus: Nothing terribly new. Got interpolation working with the software renderer, and I'm busy trying to get view frustum culling with the Alias model renderer.<br><br>[HOOK] Right now I don't think the level editors can control translucency specifically, I think r_wateralpha will control that. But I'm not sure.<br><br>[HOOK] q200: There is no GLQuake2, on the GL renderer in Quake2. It will have roughly the same raw performance as GLQuake.<br><br>[HOOK] Dragonass: You will be able to select if you want GL via 3Dfx or software rendering. You can even select \"on the fly\".<br><br>[HOOK] DJ_Rican: We support GL, not 3Dfx. Ergo we support anyone who has an OpenGL driver compatible with Quake2, which today consists of PowerVR PCX2 and 3Dfx. I'm assuming a few more will work also, including 3DLabs Permedia2.<br><br>[HOOK] DJ_Rican: Matrox probably won't be a good Quake2 accelerator.<br><br>[HOOK] Dragonass: Originally we wanted Rendition Verite support out of the box, but because of various reasons, including the loss of some key employees at Rendition and also because we have limited manpower here, we may not be able to have Verite support \"out of the box\". Verite support may be added after Quake2 ships, however. This is something we're tryingn to work with Rendition on, and will hopefully have a decision as to how we want to handle Rendition's"

      "description": "<h3>September 1, 1997</h3>Quick addendum to yesterday's numbers:<br><br>1. The WinQuake numbers were run on different graphics hardware, thus the discrepancy between their numbers. This was a stupid oversight on my part, but it definitely isn't worth running the tests again.<br><br>2. I'll benchmark Voodoo Rush the moment I get one and just add those numbers in.<br><br>3. EVEN WITH AGP, 4MB is NOT enough for decent desktop 3D with the RIVA 128. AGP gives you more texture memory, but it doesn't give you more framebuffer and Z-buffer memory, so this means that you cannot go higher than 960x704 or some screwed up resolution like that if you want double buffered, Z-buffered rendering capabilities. You might be able to run a 1024x768 desktop and render to a 640x480 window or something like that, but all in all, you will not be getting nice hi-res modes like 1280x1024 while still running 3D applications in a Window.<br><br>The V2200 and Permedia do not have this memory limitation problem.<br><br>On some other notes -- we have no intentions of doing a BeOS port or an OS/2 port, however if Be or IBM show interest we may assist them with a port after Quake2 is released on its original target platforms<h3>September 1, 1997 (part 2)</h3>Okay, yet another quick addendum to the performance figures.<br><br>1. As some of you noticed, the RIVA 128's performance scaled up quite a bit better from the P5/200 to the P2/266. This is pretty remarkable, actually, and we're not sure why. It's pretty obvious that the RIVA 128 is not fill limited, however this \"scalability\" actually indicates to me a very poorly optimized driver. So I guess this is good news in a way -- if they optimize their drivers more then they should get much faster even on the slower CPU.<br><br>2. Since it was apparent that the RIVA128 wasn't fill limited, I ran the benchmark at 800x600 to see what I could get, and what I got was pretty damn impressive: 25.7fps. I've updated the August 31 table to reflect this.<br><br>3. I was running outdated PowerVR drivers, and not only that, I was running them in \"compatibility\" mode. When I updated the drivers the performance went WAY up. I've updated the table also, but these new drivers put things in a whole new light. Unfortunately the new PowerVR drivers do front buffer rendering, so there's very visible tearing. I've been told that they'll be doing triple buffering fairly soon, which should give them the same performance we're seeing now but without the flashing/tearing artifacts we're seeing.<br><br>As you'll see with the new table, tweaking your drivers can really make a difference if you're not hardware limited. Right now I believe that we're seeing the maximum performance possible from Voodoo and PCX2 -- tests with the latter bear this out, as we tried going to 800x600 and performance dropped proportionally. The RIVA128 has a LOT of room for improvement.<br><br>Have I mentioned I'm still impressed as hell that the Voodoo is STILL the pimp?<br><br>For those of you without older .plan access, here is the new table:<br><br>Chipset P5/200MMX(32MB) P2/266(128MB)<br><br><table><tr><td>3Dfx Voodoo, GL_ZTRICK=1, nosync</td><td>33.8</td><td>33.9</td></tr><tr><td>3Dfx Voodoo, GL_ZTRICK=0, nosync</td><td>30.2</td><td>30.3</td></tr><tr><td>NEC PowerVR PCX2 (new drivers)</td><td>29.1</td><td>31.3</td></tr><tr><td>3Dfx Voodoo, GL_ZTRICK=1</td><td>27.2</td><td>27.3</td></tr><tr><td>3Dfx Voodoo, GL_ZTRICK=0</td><td>24.4</td><td>(forgot to run test)</td></tr><tr><td>NVidia RIVA128, GL_ZTRICK=1</td><td>24.0</td><td>32.2</td></tr><tr><td>NVidia RIVA128, GL_ZTRICK=0</td><td>23.9</td><td>32.1</td></tr><tr><td>NVidia RIVA128, GL_ZTRICK=1, 800x600</td><td>(didn't bother)</td><td>25.7</td></tr><tr><td>NEC PowerVR PCX2 (old drivers)</td><td>23.1</td><td>24.5</td></tr><tr><td>Rendition V2200, GL_ZTRICK=1</td><td>19.0</td><td>19.4</td></tr><tr><td>Rendition V2200, GL_ZTRICK=0 </td><td>8.8</td><td>19.2</td></tr><tr><td>3DLabs Permedia2, GL_ZTRICK=1</td><td>18.6</td><td>19.2</td></tr><tr><td>3DLabs Permedia2, GL_ZTRICK=0</td><td>18.6</td><td>19.2</td></tr><tr><td>WinQuake (software only)</td><td>13.5</td><td>12.6</td></tr></table><h3>September 2, 1997 (early AM)</h3>Dammit all, I hate giving out \"buying recommendations\", but people INSIST on asking me over and over what board to get, even though I keep telling people to get a Voodoo-based board as the \"safe bet\". So, let me state this once and for all and hopefully people will get the message:<br><br>- the 3Dfx Voodoo currently has very good performance, very good features, and it coexists reasonably well with existing video cards. It supports the portion of OpenGL we need for GLQuake, GLQuakeWorld, and Quake2. It's blazingly fast, even if long in the tooth. It's not that expensive anymore. It works with NT and Win95. Canopus has a 4MB texture version. It's VERY difficult to go wrong with the 3Dfx Voodoo. So unless you meet the following criteria, I'd say go with the Voodoo (Righteous 3D, Obsidian, Flash 3D, Canopus, whatever). And no, I do NOT mean Voodoo Rush -- I haven't tested it yet so I can't offer an opinion on it one way or the other.<br><br>Okay, so when should you NOT get a Voodoo?<br><br>Get a PowerVR PCX2 board (Matrox has one) if<ul><li>you already have a 2D accelerator</li><li>you don't care about WinNT support and plan on using Win95 exclusively</li><li>you're willing to give up high quality colored lighting with Quake2</li><li>a full OpenGL driver isn't that important to you</li><li>you wanna save fifty or so bucks over a Voodoo based board</li></ul><br><br>Get a RIVA128 board (STB, etc.) if<ul><li>you do NOT have a 2D accelerator and want a fast 2D/3D board</li><li>you don't care about Win95 OpenGL support in the next few months</li><li>you don't care about Win95 hardware accelerated Quake2 in the next few months</li><li>a full OpenGL driver (under NT) is important to you today</li><li>you can live with 4MB of framebuffer</li></ul><br><br>Get a Permedia2 board if<ul><li>you do NOT have a 2D accelerator and want an okay 2D/3D board</li><li>you need OpenGL support under both Win95 and WinNT TODAY</li><li>you need 8MB of framebuffer</li><li>you're willing to give up high quality colored lighting with Quake2</li></ul><br><br>I'm withholding final opinions on V2200, ATI Rage Pro, and Intel i740 until I have production boards with good drivers in my hands.<br><br>That's it, that's all the advice I can dispense until I do more tests, which I swear to all my pagan gods I will not do until we have Quake2 test suite.<br><br>Then again, my pagan gods are used to me lying, so I figure I'll likely run a few more tests as I get better drivers and newer boards. Hopefully, though, a Quake2 TIMEDEMO will be available in another week or two.<br><br>Oh, before I forget to mention it, we're still working on OpenGL extensions with SGI and a bunch of hardware vendors. In order of priority to us:<br><br>- wglGet/SetDeviceGammaRamp for screen flashes. This will help level performance, especially during death matches. This will be an extension that only makes sense for some hardware. It should help a lot with anyone with a full GDI/Win32/3D accelerator, and it will also help with 3Dfx.<br><br>- glColorTableEXT revved up and/or extended to support a single global texture palette. This will allow us to use 8-bit paletted textures on hardware that supports paletted textures, including 3Dfx, Permedia2, and some others. This gives us faster texture download performance (good for deathmatch), and this may make a pretty significant difference in performance for Permedia2.<br><br>- wglSwapIntervalEXT so that we can control frame rate very tightly, although I still need to talk to John about this one. This should be trivial to add though.<br><br>- EXT_point_parameters for particle rendering. This will probably only make a big difference for deathmatch performance, but it should be a reasonable performance boost across the board.<br><br>- multitexture support. This will help out rendering in the world, but it's our lowest priority since not many hardware accelerators support it. Not only that, but it would require the most effort on our part and on the part of IHVs to implement.<br><br>All of these extensions will be optional -- if an IHV wants to support an extension, then they can just do it and we'll use it if it's there. The nice thing about this is that an IHV that spends the time to do the extensions and optimize for them will tangibly see their TIMEDEMO scores increase, and so there should be a positive feedback loop established. Given two relatively equal hardware accelerators, the one that implements our supported extensions should soundly kick the other accelerator's ass.<br><br>Jesus, and I thought this was going to be a short plan update....<h3>September 2, 1997</h3><br>While I'm waiting for all my source to rebuild, I thought I'd do another small update.<br><br>OTHER HARDWARE ACCELERATORS<br><br>- Number Nine Ticket To Ride Imagine 128<br><br>We don't have one, #9 doesn't return our e-mails, and from what we've heard it's nothing to get excited about. If I get one and test it, I'll let you know.<br><br>- Matrox Mystique, Millenium, and Millenium 2<br><br>Um, no.<br><br>- S3 Virge<br><br>Um, no.<br><br>- TriTech Pyramid3D<br><br>I can't comment on their hardware, however I can say that our attitude towards the Pyramid3D is one of apathy. We have a board with drivers, and we have chosen not to concentrate time supporting or testing with their board at this time. Draw your own conclusions.<br><br>- Oak<br><br>If they get us an OpenGL driver and board, we're willing to go with it.<br><br>PORTS<br><br>Several people asked about a BeOS port, and I wasn't going to worry too much about it. However today I got a message from someone at Be asking us if we were interested in a port, and John and I discussed this and decided it was something interesting.<br><br>While Be itself doesn't knock us dead technically, the fact that it supports OpenGL is a pretty big plus, so we're willing to support them. Just so there's no suspense, here are our list of implementations and their relative priorities:<br><br>- Win32 x86<br><br>Duh. This is what we're working on full-time.<br><br>- Win32 AXP<br><br>We've reached a good waypoint with the DEC Alpha port, and probably won't worry about it until Q2TEST's release is imminent. I'm responsible for this.<br><br>- Rhapsody<br><br>John is handling this one and doing it whenever he finds the time. It's about the same priority as the Win32 AXP port -- they're both important for different reasons. Rhapsody demonstrates our portability to a radically different OS; Win32 AXP demonstrates our portability to non-Intel CPUs.<br><br>- SGI<br><br>This will likely be the result of a collaboration between SGI and id, and will probably involve having an SGI engineer on-site for a week or so to get things up and running. This is important to us because SGI is the premiere OpenGL platform, and it's just damn cool to know that out there are SGI Onyx2 InfiniteReality platforms that are running GLQuake. We want the same thing for Quake2.<br><br>- Linux x86<br><br>Zoid is handling this, and this is his biggest porting priority. We have lots of Linux fans and we want to support them, and Linux also has a pretty solid OpenGL presence.<br><br>- BeOS<br><br>We'd like to see BeOS supported after Zoid gets done with the Linux x86 port, since BeOS is yet another radically different OS and also runs on multiple CPUs (PPC and x86). Also, BeOS supports OpenGL, and we give preference to platforms with good OpenGL support.<br><br>- Linux (other)<br><br>Just as an existence proof Zoid is going to port Quake2 to all the other Linux implementations out there and see how well that works.<br><br>- Unix (other)<br><br>HP, IBM, etc. are probably going to contact us or Zoid about Unix ports in the future, and we're not opposed to these, but we're not allocating time for them until they become an issue.<br><br>- OS/2<br><br>Only if IBM does all the work.<br><br>- misc others<br><br>Other ports are \"to be determined\". I can say right now that there is NO WAY we're going to do a DOS version! An Amiga version is probably out of the question (before you flood me with e-mails, I LIKE the Amiga), as are Atari ST versions and other oddball legacy computers.<h3>September 3, 1997 (early AM)</h3>Can you believe that with all these plan updates I still manage to get a normal day's work done? We did a merge, I fixed some bugs, I spent hours working on e-mail and talking on the phone about OpenGL extension issues, and started implementing some new tweaks in the GL code. Today was mostly a non-coding day, but I still got a lot done and learned a lot of interesting stuff. Tomorrow I should get a ton of real coding done.<br><br>NOTE: The RIVA128 cracking problems are NOT the same as what you see on 3Dfx. The problems with 3Dfx are not 3Dfx problems at all, they're Quake problems, specifically T-junction issues. The cracks we're seeing on RIVA are BIG GAPING GNARLY CRACKS BETWEEN POLYGONS. These problems do NOT manifest themselves on other graphics adapters.<br><br>Oh, saw natasha.stomped.com -- mother of God, people like that EXIST?<br><br>Damn, things with hardware just keep getting better and better. Rendition has sent me a new set of drivers that GREATLY increased their performance. Not only that, but according to them their driver also syncs to vertical retrace, which means that both the RIVA128 and V2200 sync to vertical retrace, thus making comparisons to 3Dfx's no-sync numbers not particularly meaningful anymore. Note that I remove \"old driver\" scores after another table reprint, so the old PCX2 numbers have been ditched.<br><br>The new table is:<br><br>Chipset P5/200MMX(32MB) P2/266(128MB)<br><br><table><tr><td>3Dfx Voodoo, GL_ZTRICK=1, nosync</td><td>33.8</td><td>33.9</td></tr><tr><td>3Dfx Voodoo, GL_ZTRICK=0, nosync</td><td>30.2</td><td>30.3</td></tr><tr><td>NEC PowerVR PCX2, nosync</td><td>29.1</td><td>31.3</td></tr><tr><td>3Dfx Voodoo, GL_ZTRICK=1</td><td>27.2</td><td>27.3</td></tr><tr><td>Rendition V2200, GL_ZTRICK=1</td><td>26.3</td><td>27.0</td></tr><tr><td>3Dfx Voodoo, GL_ZTRICK=0</td><td>24.4</td><td>(forgot to run test)</td></tr><tr><td>NVidia RIVA128, GL_ZTRICK=1</td><td>24.0</td><td>32.2</td></tr><tr><td>NVidia RIVA128, GL_ZTRICK=0</td><td>23.9</td><td>32.1</td></tr><tr><td>NVidia RIVA128, GL_ZTRICK=1, 800x600</td><td>(didn't bother)</td><td>25.7</td></tr><tr><td>Rendition V2200, GL_ZTRICK=1 (old dvrs)</td><td>19.0</td><td>19.4</td></tr><tr><td>Rendition V2200, GL_ZTRICK=0 (old dvrs)</td><td>18.8</td><td>19.2</td></tr><tr><td>3DLabs Permedia2, GL_ZTRICK=1</td><td>18.6</td><td>19.2</td></tr><tr><td>3DLabs Permedia2, GL_ZTRICK=0</td><td>18.6</td><td>19.2</td></tr><tr><td>WinQuake (software only)</td><td>13.5</td><td>12.6</td></tr></table><br><br>Commentary:<br><br>Rendition is the most full featured of all the boards, including possessing the ability to address up to 16MB of RAM. Their MCD looks pretty good, and it even ran the Quake level editor! There was some confusion on our part since we thought we had an 8MB board, and it turns out we only have a 4MB board.<br><br>The basic conclusion is that you won't be going wrong with the V2200, Voodoo, or RIVA128 (assuming the latter fixes the cracking-between-polygons problem we've seen -- if that isn't fixed, we simply can't recommend it to anyone since that really takes away from any game experience). As we become more sophisticated with what we're doing with geometry and textures our tolerance for sloppy rasterization rules diminishes greatly.<br><br>Right now we're extremely excited about Rendition's new hardware, and we can't wait to see what they do with a Win95 OpenGL driver. And both RIVA128 and V2200 have lots of room for performance improvements when they go to a full ICD driver model. And the RIVA is posting phenomenal numbers on a P2/266, even at 800x600.<br><br>The RIVA is CPU limited, and their performance will depend largely on the speed of the system CPU. The PCX2 and Voodoo are fill limited, and thus the choice of CPU (beyond a certain point) is largely irrelevant. The V2200 is, well, driver-limited -- their drivers effectively replace the microcode in their hardware, so they're sort of hardware limited, but their hardware limits can be removed by better drivers. I think the V2200 might get a bit faster with newer driver updates.<br><br>The PowerVR is still a good bargain, but we can't say it's the best, even with its impressive numbers, because they aren't syncing and there are visible artifacts as a result -- when we get a driver with triple-buffering enabled, then the situation with hardware may change radically yet again.<br><br>An important thing to keep in mind is that 3Dfx is still the safe bet -- good performance and Voodoo works on Win95 and WinNT. Unless you're running NT, the V2200 and RIVA128 numbers are largely irrelevant. And unless you're running Win95, the PCX2 numbers are largely irrelevant. And you lose colored lighting on PCX2 (but for the price...yowza!).<br><br>The Permedia2, while showing some pretty lackluster numbers right now, promises to get much faster after we implement support for paletted textures. Assuming that they support the new paletted texture extensions that SGI and other PC IHVs will be proposing soon. You still don't get colored lighting on the Permedia.<br><br>All in all, the next couple of months are going to make the world of 3D hardware accelerated games much more interesting.<br><br>Of course, I'll be mighty surprised if 3Dfx doesn't up the ante once again very soon.<h3>September 3, 1997 (early AM part 2)</h3>The fun never stops!<br><br>As it turns out, according to someone at 3Dfx, Diamond Monster3D boards are run at 57MHz by default if you use their install tools. Since Diamond M3D boards account for the vast majority of 3Dfx boards, I allowed this one example of upclocking into the tests by doing a SET SST_GRXCLK=57 to see the effect on performance. In theory, performance should go up by about 14%, and in practice it went up by around 10%. Not bad. This does put yet another new spin on things.<br><br>Damn, where were these driver updates a week ago?<br><br>I've now removed the 3Dfx no-sync numbers, since everyone else is syncing to vertical retrace and there's no easy of disabling it on other hardware to get a feel for true performance. I've removed the GL_ZTRICK=0 numbers in order to make things clearer -- the only one that it was affect performance on was 3Dfx, and by and large people don't set GL_ZTRICK to 0 anyway.<br><br>We may have Quake2 benchmark numbers by next week.<br><br>So the NEW table follows. In the new compressed format, it simply shows that there is no clear winner, and that each board has its own merits. My previous summaries are still true, but in this format it's easy to see that RIVA128 is the best on a P2/266, 3Dfx is the best overall, and that Rendition V2200 is the best overall if you need 2D/3D. So none of those three outright suck, and they each have their strengths.<br><br>And I'm giddy about this. Man, the RIVA128 is so CPU limited that it runs faster at 800x600 on a P2/266 than at 640x480 on a P5/200. That's just weird.<br><br>Chipset P5/200MMX(32MB) P2/266(128MB)<br><br><table><tr><td>3Dfx Voodoo, 57Mhz</td><td>30.0*</td><td>30.0</td></tr><tr><td>NEC PowerVR PCX2</td><td>29.1#</td><td>31.3#</td></tr><tr><td>3Dfx Voodoo, 50MHz</td><td>27.2</td><td>27.3</td></tr><tr><td>Rendition V2200</td><td>26.3</td><td>27.0</td></tr><tr><td>NVidia RIVA128</td><td>24.0</td><td>32.2*</td></tr><tr><td>NVidia RIVA128 @ 800x600</td><td>(didn't bother)</td><td>25.7</td></tr><tr><td>3DLabs Permedia2</td><td>18.6</td><td>19.2</td></tr><tr><td>WinQuake (software only)</td><td>13.5</td><td>12.6</td></tr></table>* denotes fastest on that CPU<br># denotes no syncing to retrace, so it's going to be ugly"

      "description": "December 13, 1997 (part 2)<br>------------------<br><br>Every now and then a beast walks the landscape and devours all within its path, knowing no natural enemy.  These are the things of legend: Michael Jordan, Walter Payton, the great white shark, early Mike Tyson, and...<br><br>3DFX, ca. 1997<br><br>I've said this before and I'll say it again -- I left 3Dfx for a reason, and it didn't have anything to do with wanting to branch out and expand my horizons.  It had to do with the fact that I thought 3Dfx was confused and had a severe lack of management and direction.  So when I say good things about 3Dfx, it's not because I love that company or anything -- sure, I have some stock in 3Dfx, but the amount I have is a pittance (I negotiated poorly for stock, and I left after only 1/4 of it vested), so I don't have a financial reason to like 3Dfx.<br><br>If I say good things about 3Dfx, it's because their hardware rocks like no other hardware company can dream of.  I empathize with their situation -- they make what is  arguably the single most important piece of consumer PC hardware since the SoundBlaster, and all we keep hearing about are all the \"Voodoo Killers\" that are gonna show up \"any day now\".  I cannot stress to the world what kind of an amazing achievement the Voodoo was/is -- it easily spanked it's nearest competitor by a factor of three, which is practically unheard of.  Typically when looking at performance claims between hardware it's impressive to see someone listed as \"25% faster\".  But THREE HUNDRED PERCENT?!<br><br>That, my friends, is amazing.  And yet at times I STILL think people are constantly looking at the horizon wondering what's going to be the \"Voodoo Killa\", instead of appreciating the magnitude of what Scott Sellers, Gary Tarolli, and Jim Margeson accomplished.<br><br>id had to hear the same noise after Quake when all the \"Quake killers\" were gonna show up and even the landscape....sure, there were pretty screenshots and big performance claims and projected release dates, but when it came down to it, the first Quake killer to ship was...Quake 2.<br><br>It must be nice being a competitor of 3Dfx, since it's easy to aim for that plume of dust they're leaving in their trail.<br><br>\"So, what's the big deal?\" you may ask.  Why the big 3Dfx Cheerleading all of a sudden?<br><br>To answer that, let's just say \"I ran the numbers\".  But first, let us establish some things:<br><br>1.  The test system, as I mentioned the other day, is a pretty big, macked out, p1mped up system from hell.  It's an HP Pavilion 8190 Pentium 2/300 with AGP, 6GB HDD, some kind of soundcard (disabled for testing), etc. etc.  A pretty nice system.  Oh, and 96MB of RAM.<br><br>2.  Now, please do NOT send me mail whining that this system is not indicative of what everyone has.  I KNOW this already.  But if I test on a Pentium/200MMX, people are gonna complain that they don't know what kind of p1mped out new system to get, or they'll complain that my test system should match our minimum requirements.  If I test on a P5/133, people are gonna complain, once again, that they don't know what kind of NEW system to get, or they'll complain that I'm testing CPU performance, not hardware performance.<br><br>3.  Yes, certain accelerators are very dependent on CPU performance.  If I had a P5/133, I would NOT get a PowerVR or a RIVA128 -- these two chipsets are real dependent on CPU performance, more so than their competitors.<br><br>4.  A Pentium 2 was pretty much needed because I wanted to test AGP parts along with PCI parts.  Also, some chips like the RIVA128 are going out standard on a lot of Pentium 2 machines, so NVidia will have a (valid) argument that if I test a RIVA on a P90 that this is NOT typical of a RIVA in the field.<br><br>So, I know I can't make everyone else happy, but I CAN make myself happy.  I'm sure other people will run the benchmarks on lower end systems and print their results, so all is not lost.<br><br>5.  These numbers, and chipset opinions, are GOING TO BE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF GLQUAKE.  This may seem like common sense, but I KNOW some people are going to whine that the numbers are lower than GLQUAKE's, so please...don't.  Also, the performance dependencies of Quake2 are significantly different than that of GLQuake -- we have lots more triangles going on, and I believe a lot more textures.  This means that boards that work great with GLQuake (e.g. PowerVR PCX2) aren't so hot with Quake2, and vice versa (Permedia2 is arguably a better board for Quake2 than Quake because its triangle setup performance makes up for its poor fill-rate).<br><br>Tests were run 640x480 and 512x384, fullscreen, at 16bpp resolution, with sound disabled, using \"sync to retrace\" disabled if at all possible.  Tests were run twice, and the best of the two scores was recorded.  I did not get a chance to test the ATI Rage Pro because I don't have NT installed -- all the more reason to see these guys support an ICD -- and I did not get a chance to test the Rendition V2100 boards since they don't seem to work with the V2200 software Rendition provided.  I used DEMOMAP DEMO1.DM2 to run the test.  I also did not exec ANY configs, since this can throw off figures if you inadvertently set \"hand 2\" or something.  All tests were performed under Win95 OSR 2.1 with no other applications running.  Occasionally I would run a test at higher resolution \"just because\".<br><br>As a \"control\" number I ran the test in software, fullscreen, using DirectDraw on the Permedia2.<br><br>No overclocking of any type was done, and I did not run any \"tweaks\".  I'm trying to represent the type of performance Joe User would get if he bought his system at CompUSA, grabbed some add-in board (if necessary), then went home and played.<br><br>****************************************************<br>* sorted alphabetically                            *<br>****************************************************<br><table

Comments<br>---------------------------------<br>Let there be no doubt, there is no new sheriff in town, the current one just got a lot meaner.  Sure, the Voodoo2 4/4/4 SLI board isn't going to be that common -- but if you can afford one, you'll have performance at 1024x768 at almost DOUBLE the nearest 3Dfx competitor's performance at 512x384.<br><br>How ya like them apples?<br><br>Alright now, this is how this is gonna work.  First, all the news pages are going to post links, and eventually this plan file will be forwarded to all the appropriate people at all the various hardware companies.  All the people that are going to end up looking bad are going to bitch at me because of unfair comparisons, I didn't run on a slower machine, etc.  All the people that are looking good are going to end up bitching at me because I didn't make them look better.  Everyone is going to have nit picky gripes about miscellaneous crap, including, I'm sure:<br><br>\"we run faster in a window\"<br>\"we run faster fullscreen\"<br>\"we're scalable\" (i.e. we need a faster CPU)<br>\"they're CPU dependent\" (i.e. they suck on slower CPUs)<br>\"we support 24-bit\"<br>\"they don't support 24-bit\"<br>\"we have [insert feature here]\"<br>\"we have better image quality\"<br>\"you're using their beta drivers\"<br>\"you're not using our beta drivers\"<br><br><br>---------------------------------<br>3Dfx Voodoo<br>---------------------------------<br><table><tr><td>image quality:			good (identical to Voodoo)</td></tr><tr><td>performance:			very good</td></tr><tr><td>price/performance:		good</td></tr><tr><td>WinNT support:			yes</td></tr><tr><td>full OpenGL ICD:		no</td></tr></table><br><br>notes:<br><br>I've said it before and I'll say it again -- look at the scores, and realize just how long ago this chipset shipped.  I'm still in awe.<br><br>I didn't have a 4/2/2 so that I could run at 800x600.  When I get that I will toss it into the mix.<br><br>The Canopus didn't show any significant performance increase, but this is because I'm measuring OVERALL performance, and I'm NOT measuring transient spikes in performance (i.e. stuttering).  We're looking into ways of measuring framerate consistency in addition to measuring average framerate.  The Canopus is still definitely a better board than the Monster3D -- that extra 2MB will go a long way towards smoothing framerate, unfortunately that's simply not going to be quantified up very well under a TIMEDEMO benchmark.<br><br>That Quantum3D had decent performance, but definitely not enough to justify the price.  Note that it didn't see a huge performance boost at 512x384 vs. 640x480, indicating a throughput bottleneck of some type.<br><br>---------------------------------<br>3Dfx Voodoo2<br>---------------------------------<br><table><tr><td>image quality:			good</td></tr><tr><td>performance:			insane</td></tr><tr><td>price/performance:		unknown</td></tr><tr><td>WinNT support:			yes</td></tr><tr><td>full OpenGL ICD:		no</td></tr></table><br><br>notes:<br><br>OH MY GOD.<br><br>Fine, there were some visual glitches, but this is a pre-production board with pre-production drivers, I imagine it's going to be a bit faster when it ships. I just hope they don't pull a Rendition and take 10 months to ship.  Notice that going to SLI doesn't really buy you that much except higher resolutions -- they have so much fill rate that they are limited by throughput almost completely across the board.

      "description": "I have been getting a lot of mail with questions about the intel i740 today, so here is a general update on the state of 3D cards as they relate to quake engine games.<br><br>ATI rage pro<br>----<br>On paper, this chip looks like it should run almost decently - about the performance of a permedia II, but with per-pixel mip mapping and colored lighting. With the currently shipping MCD GL driver on NT, it just doesn't run well at all. The performance is well below acceptable, and there are some strange mip map selection errors. We have been hearing for quite some time that ATI is working on an OpenGL ICD for both '95 and NT, but we haven't seen it yet. The rage pro supposedly has multitexture capability, which would help out quite a bit if they implement the multitexture extension. If they do a very good driver, the rage pro may get up to the performance of the rendition cards. Supports up to 16MB, which would make it good for development work if the rest of it was up to par.<br><br>3DLabs permedia II<br>------<br>Good throughput, poor fillrate, fair quality, fair features.<br><br>No colored lighting blend mode, currently no mip mapping at all.<br><br>Supports up to 8MB.<br><br>The only currently shipping production full ICD for '95, but a little flaky.<br><br>If 3dlabs implemented per-polygon mip mapping, they would get both a quality and a slight fillrate boost.<br><br>Drivers available for WinNT on the DEC Alpha (but the alpha drivers are very flaky).<br><br>Power VR PCX2<br>-----<br>Poor throughput, good fillrate, fair quality, poor features, low price.<br><br>No WinNT support.<br><br>Almost no blend modes at all, low alpha precision.<br><br>Even though the hardware doesn't support multitexture, they could implement the multi-texture extension just to save on polygon setup costs. That might get them a 10% to 15% performance boost.<br><br>They could implement the point parameters extension for a significant boost in the speed of particle rendering. That wouldn't affect benchmark scores very much, but it would help out in hectic deathmatches.<br><br>Their opengl minidriver is already a fairly heroic effort - the current PVR takes a lot of beating about the head to make it act like an OpenGL accelerator.<br><br>Rendition v2100 / v2200<br>--------<br><br>Good throughput, good fillrate, very good quality, good features.<br><br>A good all around chip. Not quite voodoo1 performance, but close.<br><br>v2100 is simply better than everything else in the $99 price range.<br><br>Can render 24 bit color for the best possible quality, but their current drivers don't support it. Future ones probably will.<br><br>Can do 3D on the desktop.<br><br>Rendition should be shipping a full ICD OpenGL, which will make an 8mb v2200 a very good board for people doing 3D development work.<br><br>NVidia Riva 128<br>-----<br>Very good throughput, very good fillrate, fair quality, fair features.<br><br>The fastest fill rate currently shipping, but it varies quite a bit based on texture size. On large textures it is slightly slower than voodoo, but on smaller textures it is over twice as fast.<br><br>On paper, their triangle throughput rate should be three times what voodoo gives, but in practice we are only seeing a slight advantage on very fast machines, and worse performance on pentium class machines. They probably have a lot of room to improve that in their drivers.<br><br>In general, it is fair to say that riva is somewhat faster than voodoo 1, but it has a few strikes against it.<br><br>The feature implementation is not complete. They have the blend mode for colored lighting, but they still don't have them all. That may hurt them in future games. Textures can only be 1 to 1 aspect ratio. In practice, that just means that non-square textures waste memory.<br><br>The rendering quality isn't quite as high as voodoo or rendition. It looks like some of their iterators don't have enough precision.<br><br>Nvidia is serious and committed to OpenGL. I am confident that their driver will continue to improve in both performance and robustness.<br><br>While they can do good 3D in a window, they are limited to a max of 4MB of framebuffer, which means that they can't run at a high enough resolution to do serious work.<br><br>3DFX Voodoo 1<br>-----<br>The benchmark against which everything else is measured.<br><br>Good throughput, good fillrate, good quality, good features.<br><br>It has a couple faults, but damn few: max texture size limited to 256*256 and 8 to 1 aspect ratio. Slow texture swapping. No 24 bit rendering.<br><br>Because of the slow texture swapping, anyone buying a voodoo should get a six mb board (e.g. Canopus Pure3D). The extra ram prevents some sizable jerks when textures need to be swapped.<br><br>Highly tuned minidriver. They have a full ICD in alpha, but they are being slow about moving it into production. Because of the add-in board nature of the 3dfx, the ICD won't be useful for things like running level editors, but it would at least guarantee that any new features added to quake engine games won't require revving the minidriver to add new functionality.<br><br>3DFX Voodoo 2<br>-----<br>Not shipping yet, but we were given permission to talk about the benchmarks on their preproduction boards.<br><br>Excellent throughput, excellent fillrate, good quality, excellent features.<br><br>The numbers were far and away the best ever recorded, and they are going to get significantly better. On quake 2, voodoo 2 is setup limited, not fill rate limited. Voodoo 2 can do triangle strip and fan setup in hardware, but their opengl can't take advantage of it until the next revision of glide. When that happens, the number of vertexes being sent to the card will drop by HALF. At 640*480, they will probably become fill rate bound again (unless you interleave two boards), but at 512*384, they will probably exceed 100 fps on a timedemo. In practice, that means that you will play the game at 60 fps with hardly ever a dropped frame.<br><br>The texture swapping rate is greatly improved, addressing the only significant problem with voodoo.<br><br>I expect that for games that heavily use multitexture (all quake engine games), voodoo 2 will remain the highest performer for all of '98. All you other chip companies, feel free to prove me wrong. :)<br><br>Lack of 24 bit rendering is the only visual negative.<br><br>As with any voodoo solution, you also give up the ability to run 3D applications on your desktop. For pure gamers, that isn't an issue, but for hobbyists that may be interested in using 3D tools it may have some weight.<br><br>Intel i740<br>----<br>Good throughput, good fillrate, good quality, good features.<br><br>A very competent chip. I wish intel great success with the 740. I think that it firmly establishes the baseline that other companies (especially the ones that didn't even make this list) will be forced to come up to.<br><br>Voodoo rendering quality, better than voodoo1 performance, good 3D on a desktop integration, and all textures come from AGP memory so there is no texture swapping at all.<br><br>Lack of 24 bit rendering is the only negative of any kind I can think of.<br><br>Their current MCD OpenGL on NT runs quake 2 pretty well. I have seen their ICD driver on '95 running quake 2, and it seems to be progressing well. The chip has the potential to outperform voodoo 1 across the board, but 3DFX has more highly tuned drivers right now, giving it a performance edge. I expect intel will get the performance up before releasing the ICD.<br><br>It is worth mentioning that of all the drivers we have tested, intel's MCD was the only driver that did absolutely everything flawlessly. I hope that their ICD has a similar level of quality (it's a MUCH bigger job).<br><br>An 8mb i740 will be a very good setup for 3D development work."

Phenomenal performance for this chipset, major kudos to the S3 engineers that worked on this. This is great performance, especially given that this is without multitexturing capability!

Shows what great drivers can do for you.<br><br>Riva128ZX:<br><br>Decent performance, but it should be a little faster -- at least on a par with the Intel i740's numbers, since the Riva128ZX theoretically has higher fill rate and throughput potential.<br><br>Banshee (beta ICD):<br><br>I'm fairly disappointed with the performance here, but it's understandable since this part lacks the MT capability of the Voodoo2 boards.<br><br>OTHER HARDWARE:<br><br>We have not tested the Matrox G200 (waiting on video cards, and Matrox has warned us not to expect too much from their early drivers); we didn't bother testing the V2200 since it is pretty old tech. However, the V2200 drivers are very well done.<br><br>FUTURE HARDWARE:<br><br>I expect the Permedia3 and ATI Rage128 to perform very well. The Voodoo3 has impressive specs, but their weak point has traditionally been their ICD performance, so hopefully when that is sorted out the V3 should kick some ass. Preliminary investigation of the ATI Rage128 is that it looks really good, posting significantly higher numbers than the above using beta drivers and pre-production hardware.<br><br>We're testing with a PII/300 since that will be a mid-range system by the time Q3A ships. So for those of you that are asking for P5/200 numbers or, on the other extreme, PII/450 numbers. Sorry, I don't have the time. Extrapolation should work fine."

Damn shame about that 16-bit thing. I fear the 3500.<br><br>3Dfx Voodoo 2:<br><br>Still holds its own after all these years. A lot of that is because we actually leverage the hell out of its multitexturing capability. Honestly, if you have a V2 and you're happy at 640x480, I don't see a compelling reason to upgrade to something newer just for Q3TEST (unless you REALLY want to spend your money).<br><br>3Dfx Voodoo Banshee:<br><br>Wow, not bad at ALL. Faster than a Riva128 and it looks better too. Sure, there aren't many around, and I know a lot of Banshee users out there feel like they've been orphaned (to which I say \"Hey, at least you didn't buy a Voodoo Rush\"), so hopefully these scores will perk you up.<br><br>3Dfx Voodoo Graphics:<br><br>No, it's not even competitive, but this was a Monster 3D (4MB _total_), and it ran pretty well. Well enough that I think it's quite playable. When turning down the lodbias and subdivisions and switching to 512x384 it could post numbers > 20fps. A good card if you're on a budget and a friend is willing to give you one. Then again, being plugged into a PIII/500 didn't hurt either. :-)<br><br>ATI Rage128:<br><br>Good general purpose accelerator, right on par with a RivaTNT in most cases.<br><br>ATI Rage Pro:<br><br>Let's be frank: it's not exactly an elite graphics accelerator. However, there are more Rage Pros out there then there are atoms in the universe, so we need to make sure we run on them and run with reasonable performance. I'm generally happy with ATI's OpenGL driver performance and quality. I don't think we can really polish this one much more.<br><br>Intel i740:<br><br>Hey, for $49, it works, and it doesn't look that bad. It has reasonable frame rate, it's robust as hell, and in general it just works. If you need an accelerator and only have $50 to spend this is the one to get. It has around 60Mpixels/second fill rate, and the Banshee has around 90Mpixels/second fill rate. Banshee is about 50% faster, so it looks like both drivers are doing the best they can given the backend they're working with.<br><br>Matrox G200:<br><br>Decent board, but its drivers could use some tweaking since in theory it has performance on a par with a Banshee (~90 mpixels/second). Nice image quality and it has been reasonably solid for us (it locks up the machine about once or twice a day).<br><br>NVidia Riva TNT2:<br><br>This was on an Elsa Erazor III, so I think it's just a regular TNT2, not an Ultra. Um, it's real fast, I think that's about all I can really say.<br><br>NVidia Riva TNT:<br><br>Still a very fast accelerator, even if it's being phased out by newer chips like the TNT2. For < $100, it can't be beat. Seriously, if you have < $100 and you need to upgrade, there is NO reason you shouldn't get a TNT board from Creative (I hear that on pricewatch etc. that you can find them for $75).<br><br>NVidia Riva128:<br><br>Fairly fast, but damn is it ugly. We tested with a 4MB one, so that may be a factor in its performance. I wish we had a Riva128ZX, but we're all out here and CompUSA didn't have any. Oh well.<br><br>And when I say \"is it ugly\", I am not talking about a subtle thing. It is really, REALLY ugly, and the drivers we were running were causing all kinds of grotesque things to happen. However, we've run with a ZX before with nary a hitch, so that may have been a side effect of using a non-ZX Riva128.<br><br>S3 Savage3D:<br><br>I have a feeling that the Savage3D isn't really getting a fair shake here because its driver really need some work. If I get up to date drivers, I'll let everyone know. One nice thing about the Savage3D is that with its texture compression you can run at \"r_picmip 0\" with very little performance loss.<br><br>Rendition V2200:<br><br>*sigh* It could have been a contender.<br><br>GENERAL COMMENTS:<br><br>We can run on just about anything, and we're pretty happy about that. It's obvious that driver redistribution is going to be an issue, but we will eventually have that solved (in time for our retail release) so that hopefully people won't be returning Quake3 just because they can't get it to run.<br><br>If I had $50 to spend on an AGP accelerator, it would be a generic Intel i740 board (e.g. Jaton). If I had $100 to spend on an AGP accelerator, it would be a Creative Graphics Blaster TNT board. If I had $150 to spend on an accelerator, I'd probably go with a TNT2. If I had an unlimited budget, I'd probably either go with a 32MB TNT2 Ultra or, if I REALLY didn't give a damn about 32-bit rendering or Glide games (modulo the Creative Glide wrapper, which I have no comment on at this time), then I'd definitely opt for the V3 3500 when it comes out.<br><br>I'll eventually test a G400, Permedia3, and Savage4 and post those results, although in all likelihood I'll have to redo all the tests to remain valid.<br><br>Now that we have an \"intern\" (Eric Webb, who did all this benchmarking for us here) of sorts on board I plan on doing more benchmarking (well, actually I plan on having HIM do more benchmarking, heh) since we'll have the bandwidth for that sort of thing. Numbers on a K6-3 and PII/450 may be forthcoming if we have the time.<br><br>Great, now I get to look forward to bug reports AND hate mail. Rock out."

Thanks again goes out to Eric Webb, our trusty in-house benchmarker, for doing the tiring task of swapping cards, installing drivers, writing stuff down, rinse, repeat.<br><br>The new additions are throughput tests on an AST machine with an Intel Celeron 400MHz CPU. We didn't include the 32-bpp or 1280x1024 numbers since those numbers likely won't change appreciably between a Celeron and PentiumIII (since they're effectively differences in the graphics accelerator, not the CPU).<br><br>The truly relevant scores for us are:<br><br>- Celeron 400 @ 640x480x16bpp<br>- PIII/500 @ 640x480x16bpp<br>- PIII/500 @ 1280x1024x16bpp<br>- PIII/500 @ 1280x1024x32bpp<br><br>We also have some new additions, including a Riva128ZX, Savage4, V3 2K, and a Matrox G400 MAX. We didn't test the ZX or V3 2K on the PIII/500 due to time constraints.<br><br>From this data we can gather the following interesting information:<br><br>- performance penalty for 16-bit vs. 32-bit for each accelerator<br>- whether hardware is being saturated, and by inference, whether a driver<br>could use more optimization<br><br>If dlights are disabled, then the V3 actually pulls ahead of the Savage4,likely due to faster texture upload performance on the V3 and its drivers.<br><br>Performance Hit for 32-Bit<hr><br>Rage128 @ 640x480: 12%<br>Rage128 @ 1280x1024: 28%<br><br>RivaTNT @ 640x480: 12%<br>RivaTNT @ 1280x1024: 48%<br><br>RivaTNT2 @ 640x480: 4%<br>RivaTNT2 @ 1280x1024: 40%<br><br>Matrox G200 @ 640x480: 0% (driver maxed out?)<br>Matrox G200 @ 1280x1024: 28%<br><br>Matrox G400 MAX @ 1280x1024:13% (16-bit Z-buffer)<br><br>S3 Savage3D @ 640x480: 36%<br><br>The difference in cost for 32-bit at the different resolutions has to do with the different bottlenecks encountered at each resolution. At 640x480, you're looking at driver/CPU limitations. At 1280x1024, you're pretty much looking at pure graphics hardware limitations. The 1280x1024 numbers give you a good indicator of the absolute cost of 32-bit rendering that the hardware incurs. The 640x480 numbers give you the real world cost if you're interested in better visual quality but don't know how much performance you'll be giving up. At 640x480 the performance loss isn't that huge because much of the time being spent is feeding triangles to the accelerator.<br><br> Performance Gain from Celeron 400 to PIII 500<hr><br>These numbers are fairly easy to interpret. Since, ideally, performance would scale by ~25% moving from a 400MHz CPU to a 500MHz CPU, we'll be able to make some assumptions based on the actual performance difference. If the performance increase is LOWER than 25%, this implies that the hardware is saturated. If the performance boost is GREATER than 25%, this implies that the drivers have some room for optimization on the Celeron and/or that they are tuned for SSE instructions on the PIII.<br><br>Note that these are tested at 640x480x16bpp, since this mode emphasizes throughput.<br><br>RivaTNT2 +33.3%<br>G400 MAX +32.7%<br>RivaTNT +31.6%<br>Voodoo2 +30.3%<br>Rage128 +16.4%<br>Voodoo3 3K +9.8%<br>S3 Savage4 +8.6%<br>Voodoo Banshee +6.8%<br>G200 +6.0%<br>V2200 +5.3%<br>RagePro +2.6%<br>S3 Savage3D +2.3%<br>Intel i740 +2.0%<br><br>So the faster hardware, in general, clusters near the top, since it doesn't get saturated by the slower Celeron 400. So hardware near the bottom of the list is pretty much screaming for mommy even on a Celeron 400, hardware near the top of the list is begging for more.<br><br>The Voodoo2 number is anomalous, so I'm going to retest that at some point, and I also hope to put up numbers for our SGI and Intergraph workstations.<br><br>General Observations<hr><br>Holy Mother of Moses, did you see those G400 MAX scores at 1280x1024?! That is pure devastation in fill rate the likes we have not seen in years. Now, granted, they are running with a 16-bit Z-buffer, but still...those are pretty awe inspiring numbers.<br><br>Now, the flip side is that they're NOT the fastest at 640x480, which means that their throughput (i.e. drivers) could use some work.<br><br>The Savage4 made a good showing, however we have the caveat that this was using pre-production drivers delivered directly from S3. We hope that they will release up to date drivers soon for the Savage4. Also, the Savage4 numbers at 32-bit were using a 16-bit Z-buffer, so they had a slight advantage there also.<br><br>TNT2 didn't take top honors in many of the fields, just the 640x480x32bpp numbers, however it has the distinction of being very close to the top in nearly all tests, so it's probably the best all around board if you care about high res and 32bpp. TNT still is putting a way respectable showing, and I've seen those Creative TNT boards now for as low as $79. That is as close to a no-brainer as I've seen in a long time.<br><br>Voodoo2/3 is still putting in a very admirable show, albeit only in low res modes (Voodoo2) and 16-bit. While its performance is above that of the TNT2 in the 16bpp modes, it's not so far ahead as to have a dominating lead. And it still pales in comparison to the G400 MAX.<br><br>We received some TNT2 Ultra boards, but I couldn't get them to work. When those fire up for us I'll post the numbers, and maybe the landscape will change.<br><br>Those G400 MAX numbers are high enough that I'm nervous about them, as inmaybe I did something wrong, but so far I've run the tests on several machines, and it's pretty difficult to cheat with your drivers when you're fill rate bound."
